recurring questions:
 - average inputs / factors over days
 - which outcomes to include
 - factors to include / factor categories to include
 - include outcomes as inputs
 - pair factors / yes-no
 - top n or threshold
 - correlation threshold
 - chart types

    Reports - lots of info one one thing, one page
        e.g. frequency, proportion of good days with this thing / bad days
        is it better to have more of this thing or less of this thing (dosage/frequency)
        What is the timeline before this thing starts to have an effect?
        what is this this best combinedd with?
        What is this thing least beneficial when combined with?
        by intake
        by factor
        by outcome
